## CRM - Cluster Remote Management is a web application for system admins:

1) To view their cluster network health via dashboard
2) Provide a front end interface to login to their cluster nodes remotely

## CRM will also provide a user login for users to load and visualize data against the cluster

## The initially built with Angular, Jquery in the front. Flask as the web framework, mongodb as the NoSQL database. Various scripts to query Linux system stats are needed as well

## Prerequisites
1) Create and network the nodes to form a cluster. For this project I clustered together Ubuntu VMs via Virtual Box on a laptop. Instructions on how I put these nodes together to follow.
2) Virtual environment needs to be installed - see flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/installation for more information
